 Are you excited about reinforcement learning, deep learning and want to see how robots learn new behaviors in simulator or the real world? Ever felt the need to run experiments on a robot arm, or a robotic dog? Or are you not afraid of hardware and think spending time in a robotics laboratory and working out how to use camera systems, onboard sensors and motors to push forward the research in robotics is exactly your thing? Then contact me with your ideas or proposals of what you would like to work on during your thesis via email - k.s.luck -at- vu.nl.

This project requires:
 - Basic understanding of reinforcement learning & deep learning
 - Python
 - Pytorch
