This is an open-ended research-driven thesis project. The main idea is to investigate the question if for vision-based reinforcement learning we can evolve an attention mechanism reducing the state space from a full image (eg 256x256 pixels = 65536 state dimension ) down to a handful of pixels we need to pay attention to for a successful learning of a policy in reinforcement learning. This thesis topic combines [Offline Reinforcement Leanring](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01643.pdf), Evolutionary Methods, [Meta-Reinforcement Learning](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v100/yu20a/yu20a.pdf) and Continuous Control Tasks in the robotics domain. Initial experiments are to be done in the Mujoco physics engine - applying the final method on a robot arm or quadruped in the real world would be possible. For example, [visio-motor control of a legged robot](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.14341.pdf) would be an interesting appliction.

This thesis requires:
 - Ability to perform literature research
 -  reading research papers, formulating your own research ideas with the help of the supervisor
 - Basic to intermediate knowledge in reinforcement learning & deep learning
 - Requires Python
 - Pytorch desirable
