Classically, in reinforcement learning, we are strongly focused in exploring states and actions to maximize our objective/cost/reward function. This means to focus or attention in the high-dimensional state and action spaces only on these regions, where we expect high rewards. The question we want to investigate in this thesis is if this may be disadvantageous if  we rely and utilize the interpolation and generalization properties of deep neural networks to estimate the performance of the agent in regions of the state space we have not explored yet. Can we learn a second policy dedicated to maximize the information gain while learning a task-optimal policy to improve stability and interpolation of our Q-function and policy? This thesis will use as a starting point our earlier research into the use of RL for the evolution of robot designs.

This project requires:
 - Basic understanding of reinforcement learning & deep learning
 - Python
 - Pytorch
